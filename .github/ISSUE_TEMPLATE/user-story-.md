As a Process Lead
I need to enhance the OESuite by adding NEXT and PREVIOUS button to each od step of the MOC workflow.
So that the system will be simpler and easier forward and backward.
Currently, after completing the first step of the MOC process (initiation), users find themselves at the bottom of the page. To proceed to the next step, they must scroll back up to locate the next tab. This additional navigation requirement can lead to frustration and inefficiencies in the workflow.
In contrast, systems such as Camms and INX provide a more intuitive user experience by incorporating a "Next" button at the bottom of each step. This feature allows users to easily advance through the process without the need to scroll back, significantly enhancing usability. By adopting a similar approach in the OESuite, we can improve the overall user experience and streamline the MOC process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.
